A shaman is responsible for the sacred needs of his tribe, mediating with the tribe’s ancestral spirits and totem animals, and conducting the tribe’s religious rituals. Through his relationship with sacred powers such as gods, powerful ancestors, and animal spirits, the shaman can heal the sick and afflicted, divine wise courses of action, and smite the enemies of his tribe. In the Auran Empire, members of the class might be druids of Rorn, rune-casters of Jutland, medicine men of the Skysos horse peoples, or witch doctors of the Ivory Kingdoms. While most shamans spend their entire lives with their tribe, some shamans are called to adventure by dreams and visions; others adventure out of a desire to learn secrets unavailable in their homelands.",
