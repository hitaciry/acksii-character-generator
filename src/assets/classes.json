A shaman is responsible for the sacred needs of his tribe, mediating with the tribe’s ancestral spirits and totem animals, and conducting the tribe’s religious rituals. Through his relationship with sacred powers such as gods, powerful ancestors, and animal spirits, the shaman can heal the sick and afflicted, divine wise courses of action, and smite the enemies of his tribe. In the Auran Empire, members of the class might be druids of Rorn, rune-casters of Jutland, medicine men of the Skysos horse peoples, or witch doctors of the Ivory Kingdoms. While most shamans spend their entire lives with their tribe, some shamans are called to adventure by dreams and visions; others adventure out of a desire to learn secrets unavailable in their homelands.",

    "description": "While mages are sometimes colloquially referred to as warlocks, the true warlock is a far more sinister individual. A warlock is one who seeks alliance with dark beings and pursues forbidden lore, hoping to find a quicker, easier path to power than the methodical practices of magecraft. Many warlocks become adventurers to plumb the secrets of dusty tombs, forgotten crypts, and hidden sanctums. Few do so for heroic motives. These practices leave warlocks reviled and condemned in the Auran Empire. The Tower of Knowledge bars known warlocks from its august halls entirely. Warlocks are treated with respect and more than a little fear in the Sunset Kingdoms of Kemesh, Somirea, and Celdorea, and many assume positions of power in those societies.",
