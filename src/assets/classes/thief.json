  "description": "Where other classes rely on their valor in battle or power with magic, thieves rely on cunning, stealth, and subterfuge. Sometimes a thief will belong to an organized criminal syndicate from the character’s local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. However, many adventuring thieves are independent of any guild, and some even refuse to call themselves thieves at all — preferring terms such as expert treasure hunter, gentleman adventurer, or dungeoneer. In the Auran Empire, thieves are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura.",

They have fighting style proficiency with the dual weapon and two-handed weapon styles, but not with the weapon and shield style.",
  "combatProgression": "Thieves advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. They do not gain any bonus to damage as they advance in level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per every two class levels (rounded down).",
