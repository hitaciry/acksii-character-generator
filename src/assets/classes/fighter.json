  "Description": "Fighters are experts in the arts of combat and war. In the Auran Empire, fighters might have learned their arts as legionaries or cataphracts in the Imperial Army, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders off the Jutland coast, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.",
  "Combat Characteristics": {
    "Combat Proficiencies": "Fighters have weapon proficiency with all weapons, armor proficiency with all armor, and fighting style proficiency with all three optional styles (i.e. the dual weapon, two-handed weapon, and weapon and shield styles).",
    "Combat Progression": "Fighters advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. They can cleave after killing a foe a maximum of once per round per class level."

      "Description": "The fighter is highly experienced in military discipline, physical fitness, and weapon drill. He can automatically identify the battle standards, equipment, great captains, military slang, and rank insignia of his homeland. He can identify those of other realms with a proficiency throw of 11+. He can fight as a regular (rather than irregular) in formed and loose units. He can begin play as a member of a legion, mercenary’s guild, or other military organization (Judge’s discretion)."

  "Additional Class Powers": [
    {
      "Level": 5,
      "Power Name": "Battlefield Prowess",
      "Description": "The fighter’s presence inspires troops he leads. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter’s Charisma or proficiencies."

    {
      "Level": 9,
      "Power Name": "Castle",
      "Description": "By acquiring a castle or fort worth at least 15,000gp, the fighter can attract followers to his service. 5d6 × 10 0th level troops and 1d6 fighters of 1st – 3rd level arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him acquiring the castle. If the fighter already has a castle, the followers arrive to serve him within 1d3 months of him reaching 9th level. The fighter must pay his followers the ordinary rates for mercenaries and henchmen or they leave his service. In time, the fighter might become a great lord, commanding armies to conquer vast realms. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the Campaigns chapter."
